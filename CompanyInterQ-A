Rest contreoller and controller.

ANS - 
@Controller
Purpose: It is used to define a standard web controller that can handle HTTP requests and return views.
Return Type: Methods annotated with @Controller typically return ModelAndView or a view name as a String, which is resolved to an actual view (like a JSP or Thymeleaf template).
Usage: Commonly used in traditional web applications where server-side rendered views are returned to the client.
Example:
java
Copy code
@Controller
public class MyController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "hello"; // This is the name of the view (e.g., hello.jsp or hello.html)
    }
}
@RestController
Purpose: It is a specialized version of @Controller used to create RESTful web services. It simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs by eliminating the need to annotate every @RequestMapping method with @ResponseBody.
Return Type: Methods in a @RestController return data directly (usually JSON or XML) instead of a view. The returned data is automatically serialized into the appropriate format (typically JSON).
Usage: Commonly used in RESTful web services where the focus is on returning data rather than views.
Example:
java
Copy code
@RestController
public class MyRestController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, World!"; // This will be returned as a plain text response (or JSON/XML if it's an object)
    }
}

Annotation:

@Controller: General-purpose controller for handling web requests and returning views.
@RestController: Specialized controller for RESTful services that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.
Response Handling:

@Controller: Methods return views, with model data passed along for rendering on the server side.
@RestController: Methods return objects that are serialized directly into HTTP response bodies (usually JSON).
View Resolution:

@Controller: Returns a view name, and the view resolver resolves it to a concrete view.
@RestController: Directly returns data, bypassing view resolution

Find the very first non-repeating character in a string array

Input: String [] strArr={"apple","aappllee","","aabbcde","kettle"};
Output: Character [] chArr={'a','0','\u0000','c','k'};


Given an array of random numbers, push all the zeroes of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given array is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements should be same.
Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).
