Find the very first non-repeating character in a string array

Input: String [] strArr={"apple","aappllee","","aabbcde","kettle"};
Output: Character [] chArr={'a','0','\u0000','c','k'};


Given an array of random numbers, push all the zeroes of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given array is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements should be same.
Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).
